# flowchart-tw5

# wrapper for flowchart.js
http://flowchart.js.org

place <$flowchart> widget and then flowchart language in between tags.

#TODO
1. better error handling for preview
2. pass in flowstates to widget
3. Can't handle hyperlinls in flowchart due to what looks like a parsing bug. Probably a conflict between TW5 syntax and flowchart's
