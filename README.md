# flowchart-tw5

# wrapper for flowchart.js
http://flowchart.js.org

place <$flowchart> widget and then flowchart language in between tags.

#TODO
1. ~~better error handling for preview~~
2. ~~pass in flowstates to widget~~
3. Can't handle hyperlinks in flowchart due to what looks like a parsing bug. Probably a conflict between TW5 syntax and flowchart's (escaping the forward slashes seems to make it possible to link to external sites)
4. allow wiki links to be used in flowchart.
5. make external links go create new tab and not use TW's.
