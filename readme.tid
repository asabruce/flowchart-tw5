This is a TiddlyWiki plugin for using flowchart.js and sequence-diagram.js

It is completely self-contained, and doesn't need an Internet connection in order to work. It works both in the browser and under Node.js.

It is currently based on [[flowchart.js v.1.6.3|http://flowchart.js.org]] and [[js-sequence-diagrams v1.0.6|https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/]]
